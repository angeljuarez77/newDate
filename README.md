# new Date()

Have you become elitist and decided that non-Software Engineers are beneath you?
Do you just want to be with someone with a lot of money (who is also a Google engineer?)
Maybe you actually want to realize. Just how many women are _not_ developers. And how many men are.
Well... This is **_the_** dating app for you!

#### What's the point...?
There will be a barrier of entry to this application.
You have to successfully complete a coding challenge.
There will be a series of coding challenges that you could take at your discretion.
The more coding challenges and the harder coding challenges you complete. The more perks you get.

People get to like or dislike each other.
Unlike most social apps design to connect you to others you outright see who has already liked you and who you liked.
There is always the ability to look back to past people you like and dislike them instead.

You can NOT send someone a message until they like you back.
Again, if you like someone the _other_ person could see that you liked them.
And you could see people that liked _you_.
**_Even if it was not mutual._**

## Technologies Used
I also would like to make an application that uses

### Backend
* Microservices
  * Docker
  * Kubernetes
* Springboot
  * Maven
  * Java 8
* CI/CD
  * CircleCI
  * \>= 80% testing code coverage for backend application
### Frontend
* React
* Webpack

## ERD - schema for Database

## MVP - Minimum Viable Product
* Sign up process
  * User creates account and confirms email
  * Users **_have_** to complete the coding challenge to be able to use our platform after email confirmation
* Basic like/dislike functionality
  * Users get to see who liked them (be it themselves or someone else)
  * Users are able to dislike people that like them (therefore ending any possibility at interaction)
  * Users are able to dislike someone _after_ they became a mutually liked account
  * Send messages between _mutually_ liked accounts
* Settings
  * You could choose to show your age
  * You could choose to show your company
* Users are able to choose which technologies/languages you're interested in (toggle)

## Post MVP - The Dream
* You are able to choose if you're looking to date or work on projects together
* User is able to OMIT other accounts from being shown based on what interests they have (Think of the great Vim vs emacs war)
* Honestly probably anything lol
